# Mercy Of The Shadows

## Group:
	Stefan H. Gregersen | Tarllark

## Summary:
A basic 3D first person stealth game. The players objective is to sneak past sentries looking for intruders, and find scattered key objects, and the corresponding locks to beat the game.
Given enough time a simple ability system will be added, so the player can upgrade their character.
